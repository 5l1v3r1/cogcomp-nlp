# External Annotators 

Here we maintain lightweight wrappers to external (non-CogcComp) annotators. 
We sometimes use them or compare against these external tools. 
Here is what we currently have: 

| Annotator  | Description                                                                          | Link                                |

| PathLSTM   | Semantic Role Labeling system introduced in [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07515) | https://github.com/microth/PathLSTM | 
|            |                                                                                      |                                     |
