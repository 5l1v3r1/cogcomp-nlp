# illinois-transliteration

This is a port of Jeff Pasternack's Code from "Learning Better Transliterations."

Note: the methodology is to copy all code directly over, and rename each file
from .cs -> .java. This is obviously not going to compile, but over time it should
work.

Another note: this depends on some libraries called Pasternack, which I have no
idea where they are.
