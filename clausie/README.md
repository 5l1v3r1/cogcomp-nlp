# ClausIE 

ClausIE is an open information extractor; it identifies and extracts relations and their arguments in 
natural language text. ClausIE first detects "useful" pieces of information expressed in a 
sentence, and then represents this information in terms of one or more extractions. 
The representation of these extractions can be flexibly customized to the underlying application (e.g., binary or n-ary propositions).

More details can be found in [1].
