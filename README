NOTES:
LocalCommaClassifier is being trained on train_commas
Constraints are applied one at a time
All constraints seem to be hurting performance
The oxfordComma constraint is not working as expected and for some reason is not respected by the jointClassifier
	Example of Comma Constraint not being respected:
	"Biscayne Securities Corp. , of Lauderhill , Fla. ,[Attribute] and a principal of the firm , Alvin Rosenblum of Plantation , Fla. , were jointly fined $ 20,000 and given 10-day suspensions for allegedly selling securities at unfair prices ."


TO RUN:
Generate data by runnning CommaReader. It should shuffle the data inside divideTDT. the txt files will be wrong. Only use *.ser
lbj:clean
lbj:compile
Run ClassifierComparison to get the results table for each of the constraints on the test data
