ANNOTATING COMMAS IN SINGLE SENTENCES
-------------------------------------

This document describes the comma resolution problem, 
indicates the types of comma usage we are interested in, 
and specifies the annotation format we require to help us
train machine learning software to solve this problem
automatically.  



SOME PRELIMINARY NOTES
----------------------

The terminology we have used to define
the different phenomena may not be used in strict 
accordance with prevailing linguistic trends; if you
have a better term for a given case, please explain
it to me in simple language, and if I think it's
appropriate I'll modify our specifications accordingly.

In addition, if you think any of the examples we 
provide below are unclear or incorrect, please let me
know and we'll work with you to improve them.

"We" is used throughout to refer to Prof. Dan Roth, 
Vivek Srikumar, Yuancheng Tu, and Mark Sammons, all 
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 
together with Roi Reichart of Hebrew University, 
Jerusalem, Israel. "I" refers to Mark Sammons. 





PROBLEM SETTING
---------------

We are interested in recognizing relations between
entities in natural language text.  Often, relations
that are understood by a human reader are not explicitly
represented (e.g. with a verb) in the text, but relies
on other markers, such as punctuation, to express them
instead.  One such marker is the comma, which can be
used in a variety of ways to mark relations between
different parts of a sentence.

We would like to train machine learning tools to recognize
these implicit relations when they are present, and are 
beginning with relations represented by commas.  Commas
are used in a number of ways, some of which mark relations 
we are interested in, and others which do not bear on our 
current task.  In this document we outline our 
classification of commas, and where appropriate, the
relations they represent.  




ANNOTATION TASK
---------------

The annotation task is to read sentences from news 
articles (which will be provided either as a text file or 
via a user interface), mark each comma structure with a 
number, and then write for each numbered comma structure 
its type and the relations that it represents.  The 
relations should consist as much as possible of words 
from the original sentence, ideally in the same order 
as in the original. 

Sequences of words whose order is preserved in this way
should be marked with square brackets in the new relations.
New words that had to be introduced to make the new
relations well-formed sentences should be marked with
curly braces.  We would like to minimize the number
of new words that are introduced to a single token 
expressing a relation, such as the correct person and
tense of the verb "be", as in the example below.
The tense of this new verb should be consistent with
the rest of the sentence, in terms of number and tense.
If the appropriate tense is not clear, use the present 
tense.

For Locative relations, the new words should always 
be "be located in" (the tense and person of 'be' 
should fit the context of the original sentence).

For cases where a noun phrase modifies an entity in 
an Entity Substitute structure, if adding a single 
token representing a determiner (typically, "the")
makes the resulting relation more like a natural
english sentence, it may optionally be added.


For example, the sentence 

   John, the group's spokesperson, stepped forward. 

contains a non-restrictive modifier marked by two commas.


It would be annotated like this:


   John [1], the group's spokesperson [1], stepped forward. 


   TYPE: 

   [1] Entity Substitute

 

   NEW RELATIONS:
   
   [John] {is} [the group's spokesperson]
   [John] [stepped forward]
   [The group's spokesperson] [stepped forward]
   

Note the chunk boundaries -- indicated with square brackets --
which represent contiguous text spans from the original sentence.
These should be consistent between new relations -- i.e. if
"John" appears as a separate chunk in one relation, it should
appear as a separate chunk in other relations that correspond
to the same originating comma structure, even if it appears 
next to words contiguous in the original sentence (see below 
for examples).



The remaining entries in this document specify the types
of comma, examples of their occurrence, and examples of 
relations that can be extracted for each example. 

The comma types we have identified are:


Entity Modifiers:
 -- entity substitute
 -- entity attribute


Locative Modifiers


List


Other 


All commas not covered by the first 4 types  should be annotated with 
type "Other", and with no new relations generated.  

'Other' commas include:

 -- independent clause separator
    e.g. "We washed the dog, and then we cleaned up the mess."

 -- coordinating sentence parts with conjunctive adverbs (e.g. also, however,
    instead) or with 'not'
    e.g. "John saw the car crash; moreover, he saw the driver running away afterward."
    e.g. "John wanted to improve his company's profile, not drag their name through the mud."
    e.g. "Although John wanted to sell more cars, he couldn't cheat his clients."
    e.g. "John and Mary like milk, as does their mother."

 -- date format -- e.g. "Friday, July 15".

 -- titles that follow names, e.g. "Ken Griffey, Jr."
    
 -- commas in numbers -- e.g. "$28,000"

 -- commas immediately before quotation mark, e.g. "'John loves apples,' his mother replied."

 -- verb modifiers (e.g. "after the war, they settled down").




In the rest of the document, each type of comma is handled in turn.
Additional guidelines that cover all comma types are given at the
end of the document, under "Some Annotation Advice".  This includes
guidance on chunk boundaries, and on introducing into new relations
words that were not in the original sentence.

Entity Modifiers
----------------

The class of structure we call Entity Modifiers describes 
cases where a comma separates a noun phrase from a phrase that
modifies it, and where typically a relationship exists between
the noun-phrase NP and the modifier M such that we understand
"NP is M".  The modifier M might be another noun phrase, 
an adjectival phrase, or something else.  

We identify two main kinds of modifiers: Entity Substitutes
(which in some sense indicate an equivalence relation between
the modifier M and the noun phrase NP) and Entity Attributes
(which indicate an attributive relation, i.e. the noun phrase
NP has the attribute M.)  

In the first category, you can create a new sentence by
removing the modifying phrase from the original sentence
and using it to replace the entity it modifies.  For example:

    Billy, the school bully, went home. 

Here, the phrase "school bully" modifies "Billy".
We can identify this as an Entity Substitute because
we can drop "the school bully" from the sentence 
and use it to replace "Billy", and still get a well-formed
sentence:

   The school bully went home.

We therefore recognize Entity Substitute modifiers as
expressing three relations that can be expressed as
simpler sentences.  The sentence "E, M, RoS" (which stands
for "Entity, Modifier, Rest-of-Sentence") corresponds
to the three simpler sentences
  E is M
  E RoS
  M RoS

In the example above, E = "Billy", M = "the school bully"
and RoS = "went home", giving the new relations:

  Billy is the school bully
  Billy went home
  The school bully went home

In the second category are examples like the following:

   Billy, 12 years old, went to school.

Here, the modifying phrase "12 years old" gives us more
information about the entity "Billy", but cannot be
substituted for "Billy" in the sentence to create a new
well-formed sentence:
 
   12 years old went to school.

So we consider this kind of modifying structure an 
Entity Attribute structure, because it strictly defines
a property of the entity without itself constituting
an entity.  In our former notation, the new relations
for this type of sentence follow this pattern:
  Original sentence: 
    E, M, RoS

  New sentences:
    E is M
    E RoS

For the example: "Billy, 12 years old, went to school"
we get:
   E = "Billy"
   M = "12 years old"
   RoS = "went to school"

so the new sentences are:

   Billy is 12 years old
   Billy went to school


Some more sentences and their types:

Example 1.

Billy, 12, editor of the school magazine, went to lunch.

E = Billy
M = 12, editor of the school magazine
RoS = went to lunch

Type: Entity Attribute (because the sentence "M RoS" is not 
well-formed)


Example 2.

Billy, 12-year-old editor of the school magazine, went to lunch

E = Billy
M = 12-year-old editor of the school magazine
RoS = went to lunch

Type: Entity Substitute (because M RoS is reasonably well-formed).


Example 3.

Billy, wishing he were elsewhere, sat in his classroom.

E = Billy
M = wishing he were elsewhere
RoS = sat in his classroom

Type: Entity Attribute


In some cases, it may be necessary to drop a word from the modifying
phrase to create the new sentences.  This is generally true where the
modifying phrase starts "which" or "that", and the first word must
be dropped to create a well-formed sentence for the new relation
pattern "E is M".

 
Example 4.

Billy, who owned a bright red bicycle, rode to school.

E = Billy
M = owned a bright red bicycle
RoS = rode to school

New relations:

Billy owned a bright red bicycle
Billy rode to school

Type: Entity Attribute



Example 5.

Billy, who was driven by his parents, arrived early.

E = Billy
M = was driven by his parents
RoS = arrived early

New Relations:

Billy was driven by his parents
Billy arrived early

Type: Entity Attribute



Example 6.

Billy, whom Mr. Smith suggested should be hall monitor,
arrived early.


E = Billy
M = whom Mr. Smith suggested should be hall monitor
RoS = arrived early

New Relations:

[Billy] {is} [whom Mr. Smith suggested should be made hall
monitor]
[Billy] [arrived early]

Type: Entity Attribute

Entity Substitute
-----------------

John, the group's spokesperson, stepped forward. 


Annotation
----------

John [1], the group's spokesperson [1], stepped forward. 



TYPE: 

[1] Entity Substitute


RELATIONS:  

1. [John] {was} [the group's spokesperson].

   [John] [stepped forward].

   [The group's spokesperson] [stepped forward].


NOTES:
------


Entity substitutes should result in 3 new relations: 
one from the modifier and the entity modified, and two 
from the main predicate (here, "stepped forward").

The new plant, located in Chinchon about 60 miles from Seoul, 
will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control 
products in South Korea, the company said. 


ANNOTATION:

The new plant [1], located in Chinchon about 60 miles from Seoul [1], 
will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control 
products in South Korea [2], the company said. 


TYPE: 

[1] Entity Attribute

RELATIONS:

1. [The new plant] {is} [located in Chinchon about 60 miles from Seoul].
   [The new plant] [will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control 
   products in South Korea, the company said]. 

2. (no new relations)


NOTES:

The first relation, consistent with the other examples above, ignores
the clause ", the company said".  This is OK semantically because the
appositive construction is generally used to express facts even in
the context of a construction like "said" or "according to", as in
the above example.


================================================================

A Complex Example
-----------------

Norman Ricken, 52 years old and former president and chief operating officer of 
Toys'R'Us Inc., and Frederick Deane Jr., 63, chairman of Signet Banking Corp., 
were elected directors of this consumer electronics and appliances retailing chain. 


NOTE: this example is hard because it has multiple entities that take
modifiers and share a predicate structure, and because the modifiers are compound
and non-parallel (the first is a conjunctive compound, the other is a list
of modifiers).


Annotation
----------

Toys'R'Us Inc. [1], and Frederick Deane Jr. [2], 63 [3], chairman of Signet Banking 
Corp. [2], were elected directors of this consumer electronics and appliances 
retailing chain.

   Toys'R'Us Inc., and Frederick Deane Jr.,] [63, chairman of Signet Banking Corp.]
   [, were elected directors of this consumer electronics and appliances retailing chain] 



NOTES:

Note again the chunking of the second relation of comma set "2": 
Frederick Deane Jr. is marked as a separate entity because another
relation for the *same* commas indicates the boundaries.

NOTES

The second comma could be omitted in practice, though I think
grammarians prefer it to be there.  
The list entries should be parallel -- for example, 'John' is not
considered part of the first list entry because the other entries
are verb phrases.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


LOCATIVE MODIFIERS
------------------

Locative modifiers are comma constructions where the modifier
is a location, and the comma abbreviates the relation "is
located in". 

Locatives behave much like Entity Attribute; they are given
a separate category because the relationship expressed in
natural language is different from that of Entity Attribute.

Locatives always generate two new relations.  In many cases,
they might conceivably generate 3; but because the distinction 
between such cases and those where only 2 relations can be
generated are due to the semantics of the sentence in each
case, we conservatively require that only two new relations
be generated by locative modifiers.

=========================================================

minimizes confusion.

These are some examples of sentences with multiple comma types.
Rather than try to enumerate all possible relations in which

local transformations.

"The" in such cases, marking with curly braces the fact that this
word was not in the original sentences.

Some Annotation Advice
----------------------


* One type per chunk

-- if you need to add both a relation and a determiner, each belongs in a
   separate chunk

  "[Mr. Smith] {is} {the} [head of the school]"



* Modifiers must be contiguous

A comma-delimited modifier must be immediately next to the entity (noun phrase)
it modifies. For example:


  The politicians formed a committee last week [1], chaired
  by Oldtown Mayor Mike Smith [2], to assess the costs.

  [1] Other
  [2] Other
 
  Note here that both should be labeled "Other" as the modifier applies
  only to "committee" and not "committee last week", and so is not
  contiguous with the entity it modifies.  


  An easier example:

  Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS in recent
  years [1], citing attorney-client privilege .
				   
  [1] Other

  Here, one might think "citing ... privelege" modifies "Many attorneys"
  rather than the verb "returned".  However, by the above requirement, 
  we cannot interepret it as an Entity Attribute.



* Order of arguments in Entity Substitute relation

-- where possible, leave the arguments in their original order.
-- if the relation makes more sense if the arguments are switched,
   you may do so.

e.g.:

An early renaissance painter [1], Billy Wilde was known for his striking use of
   color.

[1] Entity Substitute

[Billy Wilde] {was} [an early renaissance painter]
...




* How to decide where chunk boundaries are

A chunk is the longest contiguous span of text from the original text that forms 
part of a new relation, while respecting the boundaries established by the
"E is M" relation corresponding to *the same comma(s) as the new relation you
are writing*.

For example:

   James spent all his time with his best friend, a dog named Woof.

This sentence contains an Entity Substitute, and the constituents are

M: a dog named Woof
E: his best friend
RoS: James spent all his time with

New Relations (with chunks marked):

[his best friend] {is} [a dog named Woof]
[James spent all his time with] [a dog named Woof]
[James spent all his time with] [his best friend]

Note that in the last new relation, there is a separate chunk for 
"his best friend", even though the two chunks contain words that 
are contiguous in the original sentence. In this case, the first
Entity Substitute relation indicates the boundaries to use.


A harder example:

`` Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer '' or to regulate genes that cause Down 's syndrome [1], the leading cause of mental retardation [1,2], according to an NIH summary . 

COMMAS: 2 Total
1. [Entity substitute]: 3 relations
(Comments: )
[Down 's syndrome] {is} [the leading cause of mental retardation]

Note here that we dropped the ", according to...".   The rationale is that the "according to" modifier 
applies to the *relation* (i.e. "be"), not "the leading cause of mental retardation".




* How much of the sentence is Rest Of Sentence?

All of it, even if it has multiple clauses separated by punctuation.

E.g. 

  The new plant, located in Minnesota, will provide 300 local jobs and 100 tons/day
  of fresh Hydrogen Sulphide to residents of neighboring towns, according to the 
  owners, Slingshot Corp. 

  The new plant [1], located in Minnesota [1], will provide 300 local jobs and 100 tons/day
  of fresh Hydrogen Sulphide to residents of neighboring towns [2], according to the 
  owners [3], Slingshot Corp. 


TYPES:
1. Entity Attribute
2. Other
3. Entity Substitute

New Relations:

1.  [The new plant] {is} [located in Minnesota]

    [The new plant] [will provide 300 local jobs and 100 tons/day
    of fresh Hydrogen Sulphide to residents of neighboring towns, according to the 
    owners, Slingshot Corp]

2.  (no relations)

3.  [The owners] {are} [Slingshot Corp.]

    [The new plant, located in Minnesota, will provide 300 local jobs and 100 tons/day
    of fresh Hydrogen Sulphide to residents of neighboring towns, according to] [the 
    owners]

Note that "The new plant" does not have its own chunk in the last relation; this is
because there is no guidance from the "E is M" relation for the corresponding comma.



* How to handle punctuation in new relations

-- drop the terminating period. (See examples above)
-- include other punctuation just like any other word in the original sentence; 
   leave it separated from other words in the sentence by white space, as it is
   in the original sentences, and include it in chunks.



* How to handle "inline quotations"

-- if words are quoted inline, you can ignore the quotation marks when 
   determining chunk boundaries

e.g. 

    He also said that after the charges [1], and `` assuming no dramatic fluctuation 
    in interest rates [1,2], the company expects to achieve near-record earnings 
    in 1990 . '' 

   Annotation:  

    1. [List]: 1 relation
    [He also said that] [after the charges , and `` assuming no dramatic fluctuation 
    in interest rates] [, the company expects to achieve near-record earnings 
    in 1990 . ''] 



* How to label overlapping comma phenomena

Start with earliest comma, and find the corresponding closing comma (if appropriate).
Repeat for the next comma not yet labeled. 
If a comma is shared by two different phenomena, as in the example below, it
should be labeled with the numbers corresponding to both. Example:
    
  Philistine Inc., Ontario, Canada, bought out its rival.

should be labeled:

  Philistine Inc. [1], Ontario [2], Canada [1,2], bought out its rival.

  -- Here, the text span "Ontario, Canada" is a locative modifier of
     "Philistine Inc.", and "Canada" is a locative modifier of "Ontario".


* numbering/identifying commas with multiple functions
     -- if you resolve a comma-delimited modifier and the 
        new relation still requires a comma after the entity,
        the second comma should be considered to have a 
        second function (should have a second number)
  e.g: 

   According to Mike Smith [1], the manager [1,2], ``Everyone loves a winner.''

  Here, a comma is still needed even if the modifier is dropped. 






* Entities with lists of modifiers

 -- lists of modifiers are treated as a single Entity Attribute (even if its 
    entries look like substitutes), so two relations are generated.  For example:

    Tarzan, 63, Lord of the Jungle and ambassador to DRC, leapt from the tree.

    Tarzan [1], 63 [2], Lord of the Jungle and ambassador to DRC [1,2], leapt from the tree.

    
    TYPES:
    1. Entity attribute
    2. List

    NEW RELATIONS:

    1. [Tarzan] {is} [63, Lord of the Jungle and ambassador to DRC]
       [Tarzan] [leapt from the tree]

    2. [Tarzan ,] [63, Lord of the Jungle and ambassador to DRC] [, leapt from the tree]




* Lists of entities with modifiers

For any multiply occurring phenomenon, e.g. list of entities with modifiers, 
only generate relations for one instance at a time. For example:

  John [1], a manager [1], and Phillip [2], who left already [2], want to know why.

  TYPES:
  1. Entity substitute
  2. Entity attribute

  RELATIONS:
  1. [John] {is} [a manager]
     [John] [and Phillip, who left already, want to know why] 
     [a manager] [and Phillip, who left already, want to know why]

  2. [Phillip] [left already]
     [John, a manager and] [Phillip] [want to know why].

NOTE: note that Phillip is a separate chunk in the last relation, 
  but John is not. The reason is that in the last case, we are
  considering only the commas marked "2"; the information about
  John as a separate chunk comes from a separate set of commas.

        

* Cropping modifying phrases

In the previous example, the phrase "who left already" modifies
"Phillip"; but when treating this like other Entity Attribute modifiers,
simply joining the two phrases does not result in a well-formed sentence.
In such cases, it is appropriate to drop the first word or two of the
modifying phrase (usually "which [is]", "that [is]", "who [is]"...)
in order to generate the new relation.

NOTE: you should not drop a verb:

  John and Bill like Mary [1], as does their friend Scott.

Here, it is not appropriate to label 1. as "Entity Modifier",
because this would require dropping a verb from the modifier
("*as does* [their friend Scott]")


* periods in quotations

Periods in quotations are not removed in new relations, as they
do not occur as the last token in the sentence.


* lists with 2 entries, aka comma-as-conjunction
  
  Two entry lists are still considered lists, e.g. 

    Competitors feared they would be shut out because so many people had already 
    been admitted [1], and because race officials refused to answer calls.
    
  1. [List]: 
     [Competitors feared they would be shut out] [because so many people had already 
     been admitted, and because race officials refused to answer calls].
      


* lists vs nested modifiers: 
  -- e.g. A, B, C, VP
  -- if "B {is} C" is always true, and this relation is 
     semantically coherent, then C modifies B

     e.g. 

     The stock was bought up by a different company [1], Smith Inc.[2], a 
     subsidiary of Locus Corp.

     1. [Entity Substitute]
        [a different company] {is} [Smith Inc., a subsidiary of Locus Corp]
        [The stock was bought up by] [a different company]
	[The stock was bought up by] [Smith Inc., a subsidiary of Locus Corp] 

     2. [Entity Substitute]
	[Smith Inc.] {is} [a subsidiary of Locus Corp]
	[The stock was bought up by a different company,] [Smith Inc]
	[The stock was bought up by a different company,] [a subsidiary of Locus Corp]

     -- if it is truly ambiguous, interpret as nested modifiers
     (e.g.: "The animal, a cat, which is sometimes curious, VP": could be a list 
     or a nested modifier; by default we treat it as a nested modifier)

  -- otherwise, "B, C" is a list


* numbering commas that signify lists
  -- number only internal commas; ignore commas that occur at the end of a list.
   e.g.

   The men [1], women [1], boys and girls [2], all cold and hungry [2], returned home.

   1. List
   [The] [men, women, boys and girls] [, all cold and hungry , returned home]
   
   2. Entity Attribute
   [The men, women, boys and girls] {were} [all cold and hungry]
   [The men, women, boys and girls] [returned home]



* multiple sentences
  -- this is a corpus error
  -- for comma numbering, treat all sentences as single text 
     span (e.g. the first comma in the second sentence will
     have a numerical label higher than "1" if there are commas
     in the first sentence).
  -- for new relations, consider each sentence separately.
     -- e.g. "John [1], a manager [1], wept. He left the room [2], 
       which was on the 6th floor."
        -- new relations:
        1. [John] {is} [a manager]
           [John] [wept]
           [a manager] [wept]
        2. [the room] [was on the 6th floor]
           [He left] [the room]
  -- if there is a quotation that overlaps the end of the sentence:
     -- if the closing quotation mark is immediately after the period, 
        treat the quotation mark as part of the first sentence.
     -- if there are words before the closing quotation mark and after
        the period, treat the two sentences as a single sentence.

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&


FOOTNOTE 1

Locatives are not Entity Substitutes, at least, not consistently.
In the following example, the P.L. could act like an E.S.:

   London, England is to host the 2012 Olympic games

L_1 = London
L_2 = England
RoS = is to host the 2012 Olympic games

London is located in England
London is to host the 2012 Olympic games
England is to host the 2012 Olympic games



But consider this:

  London, England is the city that sometimes sleeps late in the morning.

We can't substitute England for London and get a meaningful sentence.

For this reason, we treat *all* locative modifiers in the way 
specified under the heading "locative" above.
