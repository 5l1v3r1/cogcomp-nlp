<h2>List(Elements in a Series)</h2>
<p>
One of the frequent uses of comma is the separation of three or more elements listed in a series.
The elements may be words, phrases, or clauses having the same syntactic type, cf. examples (1),
(2), and (3). The last element is usually separated by a conjunction such as and or or, and
sometimes by another comma.
</p>

	<li> Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan and Paris. (from PT)
	<li> We innovated telephone redemptions, daily dividends, total elimination of share certificates and the constant $1 pershare pricing, all of which were painfully though out and not the result of some inadvertence on the part of the SEC. (from PT)
	<li> John went shopping, Mary cooked the meal and David washed the dishes.

<p>
In some cases, the conjunction may be preceded by a comma, in order to prevent misreading. Ehrlich names this as the bacon-and-eggs problem (Ehrlich 1992: 17):
</p>

	<li> You may order anything you want at my diner as long as you order sausage and eggs, ham and eggs, or bacon and eggs.
	<li> The chef said he needed sausage, ham, bacon, and eggs.

<p> 
Independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction, such as and, or, but, etc., may be separated by a comma, if there is a risk of misreading. This is what makes Bayraktar et al's List broader than Srikumar et al's List which only included commas that were separating some kind of collection. 
</p>

	<li> The Red Cross doesn't track contributions raised by the disaster ads, but it has amassed $46.6 million since it first launched its hurricane relief effort Sept. 23. (from PT)

<p>
Coordinate adjectives, which independently modify a noun, are separated by commas, if the meaning otherwise changes:
</p>

	<li> And some US army analysts worry that the proposed Soviet redefinition is aimed at blocking the US from developing lighter, more transportable, high technology tanks. (from PT)

<h2>Introductory(Sentence-initial Elements)</h2>
<p>
A comma may delimit long phrases or clauses that appear sentence-initially as an introductory element, if there is a possibility of misleading the reader. This can be seen by looking at examples (8) and (9) for phrases and clauses respectively, and trying to read the sentences without the comma:
</p>

<li> Under two new features, participants will be able to transfer money from the new funds to other investment funds or, if their jobs are terminated, receive cash from the funds. (from PT)
<li> Although the action removes one obstacle in the way of an overall settlement to the case, it also means that Mr. Hunt could be stripped of virtually all of his assets if the Tax Court rules against him in a 1982 case heard earlier this year in Washington, D.C. (from PT)

<p>
Introductory modifiers, such as adjectives (10), adverbs (11), or participles (12), which usually consist of one word, are usually set off by a comma:
</p>

<li>Victorious, the army withdrew a thousand meters and encamped for the night. (Ehrlich 1992: 25)
<li>Clearly, the judge has had his share of accomplishments. (from PT)
<li>Running, he went up the stairs.

<p>
An absolute phrase may appear sentence-initially, in which case it is always delimited by a comma, since it modifies the entire sentence and has no grammatical connection to any other element in the sentence:
</p>

<li>The party over, the couple began to wash a sinkful of dishes. (Ehrlich 1992: 37)

<p>
It is noted that absolute phrases differ from other phrases in their capability of expressing a full idea, but unlike clauses, they only consist of a subject and a modifier.
</p>

<h2>Complementary(Sentence-final Elements)</h2>
<p>
Like sentence-initial introductory elements, sentence-final complementary elements are delimited by a comma, if there is a need for disambiguation. The element may be a phrase (14), a subordinate clause (15), or an absolute phrase (16):
</p>

<li> A bomb exploded at a leftist union hall in San Salvador, killing at least eight people and injuring about 30 others, including two Americans, authorities said. (from PT)
<li> A face-to-face meeting with Mr. Gorbachev should damp such criticism, though it will hardly eliminate it. (from PT)
<li> She ran faster, her breath coming in deep gasps. (Paxson 1986: 31)

<h2>Attribute(Nonrestrictive Phrases or Clauses)</h2>
<p>
Postmodifiers of nouns, which may be phrases or clauses, are enclosed by commas if they are nonrestrictive. Restrictive modifiers identify, define, or limit the elements they modify, and thus are essential for the intended meaning. A nonrestrictive modifier, on the other hand, may be removed without changing the intended meaning since it only adds information concerning an element already identified, defined, or limited. Examples (17) and (18) illustrate restrictive phrases and clauses, respectively, whereas (19) and (20) show nonrestrictive ones:
</p>
	
<li> The man at the left is taller.
<li> He was the only student who answered all the questions in the exam.

<p>
versus
</p>

<li> A Western Union spokesman, citing adverse developments in the market for high-yield "junk" bonds, declined to say what alternatives are under consideration. (from PT)
<li> At one point, almost all of the shares in the 20-stock Major Market Index, which mimics the industrial average, were sharply higher. (from PT)

<h2>Appositives</h2>

<p>
Appositives, also known as noun repeaters, identify or point out to the nouns they succeed. Only nonrestrictive appositives are delimited by commas, as in the case of modifying phrases or clauses, mentioned in Section 3.1.4. Example (21) illustrates a restrictive appositive, whereas (22) shows a nonrestrictive one:
</p>

<li> Alexander the Great was a powerful emperor.

<p>
versus
</p>

<li> The new company, called Stardent Computer Inc., also said it named John William Poduska, former chairman and chief executive of Stellar, to the posts of president and chief executive. (from PT)

<h2>Interrupters</h2>
<p>
Commas are also used to delimit interrupters, which occur sentence-internally as a complementary or parenthetic element. This may be a single word (23), a phrase (24), or an entire clause (25), which breaks the expected logical flow of the sentence:
</p>
	
<li> The Brookings and Urban Institute authors caution, however, that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration, and reaching the Medicaid level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays. (from PT)
<li> The new bacteria recipients of the genes began producing pertussis toxin which, because of the mutant virulence gene, was no longer toxic. (from PT)
<li> Rebuilding that team, Mr. Lee predicted, will take another 10 years. (from PT)

<p>If the comma is near the ned of the sentence and it could be an interrupter or a complementary, use complementary.
</p>

<li>Example: Biscayne has n't any telephone listing ,[Complementary] an operator said .


<h2>Quotations</h2>
<p>
Direct quotations, indicating or repeating the exact words of the writer or the speaker, respectively, are set off by commas:
</p>

<li> "The absurdity of the official rate should seem obvious to everyone," the afternoon newspaper Izvestia wrote in a brief commentary on the devaluation. (from PT)
